###### CSX3002 / ITX2001 Object-Oriented Concepts and Programming (2/2021)

## Course Description💡
Different software development methods emphasizing on object oriented methods, fundamental concepts of object oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, object oriented programming tools, class libraries, application development using object oriented concept, analysis and design of object-oriented data architecture.

## Course Objectives 🚩
The course aims to provide students essential concepts on analyzing and designing object-oriented systems. Students will learn key design issues concerning object-orientation along with design patterns that are adopted in the real-world applications.
